## About the Project 

EcoXp is a gamified recycling app built for iOS and Android designed to make sustainable habits fun and engaging. Inspired by apps like Duolingo and MyFitnessPal, it helps users track their recycling efforts, gain XP for eco-friendly actions, and compete with others to incentivise more recycling.

EcoXp offers users an interactive experience with features like:  
- Scanning recyclable items to earn XP.  
- Tracking recycling stats across friends, postcodes, and cities.  
- Taking quizzes to test and expand recycling knowledge.  
- Viewing engaging visualizations like pie charts to see progress in recycling different materials (e.g., plastic, paper, metal).  

The front-end was built with React Native, is managed with Expo, and has been styled with React Native Paper.

The back-end is a RESTful API made with postgreSQL, you can view the database, API and the different available endpoints used [here](https://github.com/louis-emmerson/ecoxp-be-js).
Much of the council and area data has been inserted for demo purposes for the time being, but this may be developed upon in the future.

## Using the App  

Currently we are working on modifying the app so that users can be authenticated and can therefore run the app locally on their mobile devices. 

In the meantime, you can view the demo video for our project as well as some info about the team [here](https://northcoders.com/project-phase/ecoxp)!
